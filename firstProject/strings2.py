# Python methods for removing trailing white spaces.
my_stripe = " Hello World Gabby "
# print(my_stripe.rstrip())  # removes the trailing white space at the right
# print(my_stripe.lstrip())  # removes the trailing white space at the left
# print(my_stripe.strip())  # removes the trailing white space at the both sides.

# How Stripe Characters that are not white spaces.
# print(my_string.strip("I"))  # Python will only do this if that character is at the end.

# Python isspace() method
# We use this method to know if a python is made up of just white spaces or not.
# This method returns a boolean.
# It does not take any argument.
# The isspace method doesn't work for empty string ""

my_main_str = "I am a string"

# Python count() method
# Find out the number of times a character appeared in a string.
# We have to pass the char as an argument.

my_str_count = "Hello World"
# print(my_str_count.count("l"))

# Python find() method.
# It is used to find a charcter or sequence of characters in a string.
# It returns the index position of the first occurence.
# If a character is not found, -1 is returned.
# Another method that works like the find method is the index method.
# But the main difference between index and find is that, any character or sequence of character that is not
# found in the string throws an error.

find_str = "Hello World"

print(find_str.find("l"))
