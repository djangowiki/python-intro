# This is the easy and recommended way to write a foorloop.
# In the recommeded way, you have to follow just two steps.
# the start should be 0, step should be 1 and the stop should be easy to figure out.
# for i in range(0, 10, 1):
# print(i)

# Python by default has a starting point of 0, and an increment of 1.
# So we can write forloops like this:
for i in range(20):
    print(i)
